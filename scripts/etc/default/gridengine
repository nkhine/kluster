# Sun Grid Engine configuration

# Boolean options in this file must be set to yes or no

# Start the queue master daemon? (if installed)
# Note: this file cannot be a shell script because the GridEngine
# tools want to parse it directly (yuk!).  So I had to mess with
# the gridengine-master startup script in /etc/init.d to not
# start the master if this host is not called 'master'
SGE_START_MASTERD=yes

# Start the execution daemon? (if installed)
SGE_START_EXECD=yes

# SGE_ROOT will default to /var/lib/gridengine
SGE_ROOT=/var/lib/gridengine

# SGE_CELL will default to default
SGE_CELL=default
